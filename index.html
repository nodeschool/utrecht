					<h4>Workshops</h4>

				<h4>For who?</h4>
				<p>Basically for everyone. The level of difficulty of our curriculum ranges from beginner to advanced, so there's something for everyone to learn.</p>
				<p>With everyone, we mean everyone. To make sure everyone is able to feel welcome and safe, we have created a <a href="code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a>. The shortest version is: Don't be a jerk, be excellent to eachother.</p>
				<p>The longer version of our <a href="code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a> provides a more subtle and elaborate perspective on our point of view.</p>
