## What is Node.js?

With Node.js you can use the very popular programming language JavaScript to write software. JavaScript is usually used in a browser, but combined with other tools, Node.js allows you to write server applications, mobile applications or even desktop applications.<!-- .element: class="fragment"  -->

Note:
- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.


## Workshop format

<p class="fragment">NodeSchool workshops are <strong>hands-on</strong>. We use self guided tutorials, or <strong>workshoppers</strong>, as lesson modules. They are made up of <strong>challenges of increasing difficulty</strong> and we have <strong>40+ workshoppers</strong> to choose from.</p>

Note:
- choose-your-own-adventure style
- workshoppers work offline too
- working on your own project is fine


## Selecting a workshopper

<p class="fragment"><strong>Core</strong> workshoppers focus on essential skills for working with Node.js. If you&rsquo;re new to JavaScript and Node.js, pick these.</p>
<p class="fragment"><strong>Electives</strong> deal with more advanced topics. Pick one of these if you already have some experience.</p>
