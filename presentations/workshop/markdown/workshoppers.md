## Node.js

With Node.js you can use the very popular programming language JavaScript to write software. JavaScript is usually used in a browser, but combined with other tools, Node.js allows you to write server applications, mobile applications or even desktop applications.<!-- .element: class="fragment"  -->


## Workshop format

<p class="fragment">We use self guided tutorials, or <strong>workshoppers</strong>, as lesson modules. You can do them on your own, but we encourage you to work together.</p>

Note:
- choose-your-own-adventure style
